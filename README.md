Scientists and practitioners alike are increasingly glancing at online investment forums. Thereby,
different opinions shared with microblog messages seem to impact the decisions of capital
market traders and investors. That messages on Twitter may play an essential role for the
ï¿¿nancial industry is underlined by the globally established Financial information service provider
Bloomberg, who previously integrated live tweets on its platform in 2013.

In this seminar paper I tired to answer two main research questions regarding Financial tweets:
  1. How to extract relevant information from Financial Twitter tweets regarding companies
  of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index?
  2. How well do multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers detect whether a tweet contains relevant
  text information regarding to trading recommendations for buying, selling, or holding an
  asset?
